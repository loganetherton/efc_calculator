<h1 style="text-align: center">Expected Family Contribution Report</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your personal start to the undergraduate financial aid process.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROVISO</p>
<p>This document is an overview of the standard financial aid process system customized to the student and family based on the<br />
  information provided. This document holds no authoritative weight, is not an approval or application for financial aid but is designed to<br />
  best explain a rather easy system made complex.<br />
  The Expected Family Contribution formula is line for line the same as the FAFSA formulas and is the most up to date and accurate<br />
  calculator available.<br />
  The actual financial aid package that the student receives may vary widely from the Expected Family Contribution; the cause of this<br />
  should be made clear by the reading of this document. Additionally a small set of schools use the College Board owned CSS Profile<br />
  which takes into consideration financial elements that the FAFSA does not. These elements can include but are not limited to the value<br />
  of a small business, home equity and the like. As each school may vary the formulas and perceive them as proprietary we do not deal<br />
  with them here. A simple Internet search for “Current CSS Profile Schools” will bring up the current list.<br />
  This is an informative document and is not intended nor should it be construed as giving financial, financial aid, accounting advice or<br />
  similar. It is not designed by, for, or with, an education institution or government body. Nor is this an application for financial aid. All of<br />
  that said, we do believe as current and recent users of the financial aid system that this document is the most accurate, informative<br />
and easy to follow guide through the beginning of the financial aid process.</p>

<h1>Financial Overview for the Etherton family</h1>
<h2>1. Where the family is today:</h2>
<p>Based on the information that you provided your Expected Family Contribution is: $0.00.</p>
<h2>2. Where the family can be:</h2>
<p>If you make the recommended changes your Expected Family Contribution can be reduced to: $0.00.</p>
<h2>3. The Net Result:</h2>
<p>This change will increase student aid eligibility by: $0.00</p>
<h2>4. Details:</h2>
<p>The EFC is predominately based on four elements. These elements are run through a series of<br />
machinations but at the core they consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parents Income</li>
  <li> Parents Assets</li>
  <li> Student' Income</li>
  <li> Student's Assets</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Etherton family’s scenario, the current EFC of $0.00 is determined by: </p><hr />
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>	
    <td width="30%"><p>Parents Income: 30.7%</p>
      <p>Parents Assets: 0%</p>
      <p>Student' Income: 57.2%</p>
    <p>Student's Assets: 12.2%</p></td>
    <td width="70%"><img src="piechart.png" width="444" height="275" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When the  EFC is lowered, the new EFC of $0.00 is determined by:</p>
<hr />
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="30%"><p>Parents Income: 30.7%</p>
      <p>Parents Assets: 0%</p>
      <p>Student' Income: 57.2%</p>
      <p>Student's Assets: 12.2%</p></td>
    <td width="70%"><img src="piechart.png" alt="" width="444" height="275" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h1>5. Resolution:</h1>
<p>As the  vast majority of people are not willing to make a change in income, (nor would  it be wise), the movement of assets is what has the most effect on the EFC  calculation.  </p>
<p>By moving:</p>
<p>$  Of the parents assets and / or<br />
  $ of the  students assets<br />
From what the  EFC calculation considers liquid assets into not counted asset categories your  EFC can be lowered  by EFC – Revised EFC</p>
<p>You  may do this yourself if you would like.   If you would like to contact a trained Student Aid Calculate volunteer  you may do so by calling 34523453245.   Keep in mind that they are volunteers so if no one is available you will  be contacted shortly.</p>
